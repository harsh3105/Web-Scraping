 has already been conducted on April 4 in pen-and-paper based mode. The computer-based JEE Main will be conducted on April 10 and 11. Similarly, the  will be conducted in the computer-based mode from April 8 to April 19. The JEE Main exam conducted by the CBSE is the gateway to engineering courses offered by the NITs, IIITs, other CFTIs and all the engineering colleges and technology institutes of the participating states. It is also the eligibility for JEE Advanced exam  entrance to the IITs. VITEEE exam, on the other hand, is the gateway to just the courses offered by the VIT University.
Review of previous year papers indicate that  asked in VITEEE is believed to be much easier than JEE Mains. Moreover, there is no negative marking in the VITEEE (unlike JEE Main exam), so one can make random guesses after solving all the questions one knows well  without the fear of penalty marks.
While JEE Main 2015 is based just on CBSE syllabus of Class 11 and Class 12, VITEEE 2015 is based on both the Class 11 and Class 12 syllabus of CBSE and the Tamil Nadu state board. Hence, the VITEEE syllabus has a few extra topics. Students who are appearing for both JEE Main and VITEEE exams this year will have to prepare for these extra topics that may not be available in the study material commonly available in the markets.
In JEE Main questions are more conceptual in nature while VITEEE questions are pretty much direct and simple. Brushing up concepts and going through the solved examples should do the trick to crack these exams. Speed is quite important in both the exams. With less than a week left for the exam, it is important to attempt the full-length question papers of the tests you are targeting  in a time-based manner.
