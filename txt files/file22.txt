Crime against women, especially rape and even incest rape (sexual assault of girls/woman by those within the family) incidents, are on the rise over the last three years in Tamil Nadu.
According to the Crime in India 2013 data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there had been 7,475 cases of crime against women which included eve-teasing, stalking, domestic violence by husbands, in-laws, harassment at work place.
In 2013, Tamil Nadu a share of 2.41 per cent in the countrys total crime against women. Tamil Nadu accounted for 923 rape victims during the previous year. Victims in the age group of 14 to 18 and 18 to 30 were 280 and 395, while there were 61 and 78 victims in the age groups of up to 10 and 10 to 14 respectively.
As many as 93 victims were in the age group of 30 to 50 and 16 were aged 50 and above. Cases of incest rape were six and the victims were in the age group of 10 to 30.
With regard to girls of younger age being victims of sexual assault and abuse, law enforcers say that stringent law i.e., the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act came into force only recently.
When the cases registered under this provision reach a logical conclusion before the trial courts, the quantum of punishment could have a deterrent effect.
Statistics indicate that even children below the age of 10 have been victims and similarly sexual assault of women in the age group of 50 and above was also reported from the State.
The statistics of 2013 shows a steady increase compared to 2012 and 2011. Total cases of crime against women in 2012 was 7,192 and 6,940 cases in 2011. As far as cases of rape were concerned, there were 737 cases in 2012 while it was 677 in 2011. Cases of incest which were 2 in 2011 went up to 4 in 2012 and it had become 6 in 2013.
In more than 95 per cent of cases of rape, the offenders were either relatives or known persons.
In 2013 of 923 cases of rape, six offenders were parents/family members, 98 were relatives, 263 were neighbours and 531 were known persons. In 2012, all the offenders in 737 cases came under this category of known accused while in 2011 of the 677 cases, 675 were known offenders.
