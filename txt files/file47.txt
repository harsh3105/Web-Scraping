The Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) is one of the most prestigious private universities in India, whose alumni include some of the nations top engineers, computer software designers and other tech and research specialists.Â However, the institution, which has campuses in Chennai and Vellore (a town about halfway between Chennai and Indias tech hub, Bangalore), has recently received some unwanted negative attention with regard to how the university treats its female students.
Like at many Indian colleges, rules require male and female students at VIT to live in strictly segregated facilities, in addition to imposing restrictions upon the women that the men are not burdened by.
