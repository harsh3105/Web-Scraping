“I am required to meet with Vellore police for the third day running. My movement is restricted, my plan to attend an event in Hyderabad tomorrow is “not permitted”. The police have visited the homes and questioned the families of my co-worker, one of my students, and the owner of the house where I am staying. All are terrified”, says Dr. Moallem.
Another websitereports that those students who even met him ever since the expulsion have also come under the gamut of investigations and questioning.
